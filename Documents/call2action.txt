Call to action 

We realise how important it is to stay motivated and focused during this time when most people would find it difficult to stay positive and continue doing their tasks.
In the future we’ll be looking into contacting businesses and education for partnerships and assisting them in getting personal task management set up for students and employees. If we win we’ll be able to leverage support and recognition to help spread our product. We want everyone to be able to run their days effectively and we’re hoping you choose to support us.
