Problem (500 characters)
With the quarantine imposed by the Covid-19 pandemic, the majority of the worldâ€™s population has been forced to telecommute/work remotely. Covid has also hit alot of businesses hard with many having to drastically cut employees or close. This has created a large increase in the amount of unemployed people who are restricted to being stuck at home. 

For a lot of people this extended period at home results in a lack of discipline and motivation and therefore lower productivity, it can also be quite a mental hurdle to maintain good habits especially in such uncertain times.
